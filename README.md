## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS function, variables and nesting
-   Media queries
-   BEM naming convention

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

-   The importance of using rem instead of px for accessability reasons
-   The power of SASS/SCSS, creating functions is such a great approach

### Continued development

-   Look more into CSS pre-processors and if they are the better approach to writing CSS as opposed to vanilla CSS
-   Now that I have a better understanding of the importance of REM I want to focus on making font-sizing more responsive and look into using `clamp()`
